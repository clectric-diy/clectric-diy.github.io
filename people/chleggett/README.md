# Charles H. Leggett

## Origin Story
I have had an interest in hobby electronics ever since sitting at my father's workbench as a kid. He passed away when I was in middle school and so, I never really had a chance to learn from him and have never really had a "purpose" to build things. Enter my inspiration ...

I've been into modular synthesis for short while now and have been discouraged by the outrageous cost of Eurorack. My interest in electronics led to my interest in Synth DIY, but again, I was discouraged by Eurorack due to the extra challenge of upscaling things like the Arduino Nano to the ±12V standard. However, I purchased a Volca Modular and through it found the [AE-Modular](../../formats/ae-modular/) format. Eureka! It's a modular synthesis standard that uses a 0-5V range.

Thus, clectric is born.
## Environment
### Digital
Here's an in-exhaustive list of the digital tools that I use:

| **purpose**                   | **tool**                                  | **have used**          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| text editing                  | Vim. Flame on!                            | nvim                   |
| launcher, snippets, clipboard | Raycast                                   | Alfred                 |
| IDE                           | VSCode                                    |                        |
| note taking                   | dead trees and Obsidian                   | ReMarkable             |
| window manager                | Raycast                                   | just about all of them |
| PDF eReader                   | ReMarkable                                |                        |
| eReader                       | Audible (this counts, right)              |                        |
| "productivity"                | Sunsama (tasks) and Things (agenda items) | just about all of them |

### Physical
I live in Atlanta, GA.
Technically *The Atlanta Metro Area™* for those in the know.

#### Workbench
Having (diagnosed and treated) ADHD, my workbench (and other spaces) tend to stay messy.
This is primarily caused by the fact that I have that thing, which probably has a name, where if I don't see it, it may as well not exist.

Here's today's example. I resisted the urge to straighten it up for this photo.

#### "Battlestation"
I have heard this type of setup referred to as a "Battlestation". I am not a musician in the least bit, so you can pretty much call this a "MIDI Station" for me.

#### Desk
I admit that I cleaned up my desk and staged this next photo. I included [Ryder Carroll](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/rydercarroll?srsltid=AfmBOopI8ELUZBVgdGMqOar7f3e8x-XUOpblkBaptPDYe9-ueFj_E_ew)'s book [The Bullet Journal Method](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/book) as a thank you to him and the [BuJo U](https://community.bulletjournal.com) community for (maybe literally) saving my life.

My ride or die EDC journal is on the right and my tinkering or design or engineering or whatever journal is on the left.

## Other
To avoid this sounding like a dating profile, I have resisted the urge to write about "other interests" here.
