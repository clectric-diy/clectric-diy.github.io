# SynthDIY Designs & Services

## What is it?

Our time.

We are offering hourly blocks of consulting service(s) to help you with your own SynthDIY project(s).

## Why did you make it?

clectric was founded to give ourselves a geeky outlet for our own creativity and we *stand on the shoulders of giants* for our own success.

We want your SynthDIY project to succeed. We are not giants (yet?), but *we want you to stand on our shoulders* if it will help you to succeed in whatever SynthDIY goal(s) you have.

## What makes it special?

You do.

1) Your project is the focus. We have many resources on our [https://clectric.diy](https://clectric.diy) site and within [our SynthDIY community](https://github.com/orgs/clectric-diy/discussions), but if you would like to have one-on-one help, this is your opportunity.

2) The fee is 100% refundable if, within the first 15 mins, you decide that we won't be able to help you. We may be able to learn more from you than you do from us. If that's the case, we owe you a refund and it's your call.
