**clectric.diy** is a space for experimentation, learning, and sharing—with a growing library of notes, prototypes, and ideas always in progress. We’re here to help you build the sounds you imagine.

Members of [our SynthDIY community](https://github.com/orgs/clectric-diy/discussions) are designing and/or using modules, and related hardware, for the [AE Modular format](AE-Modular.md). Including the [Spark](https://github.com/clectric-diy/Spark-AE), an Electrosmith Daisy Seed based module, and the associated [FLUX](https://github.com/clectric-diy/FLUX) firmware.

Whenever possible, we use open source software to ensure that there's a low barrier to entry for new folks starting up and because it's often the best software available. [KiCad](Tools/KiCad.md) is a good example.
