# Charles H. Leggett

## Origin Story
I have had an interest in hobby electronics ever since sitting at my father's workbench as a kid. He passed away when I was in middle school and so, I never really had a chance to learn from him and have never really had a "purpose" to build things. Enter my inspiration ...

I've been into modular synthesis for short while now and have been discouraged by the outrageous cost of [[Eurorack]]. My interest in electronics led to my interest in Synth DIY, but again, I was discouraged by [[Eurorack]] due to the extra challenge of upscaling things like the Arduino Nano to the ±12V standard. However, I purchased a [[Volca Modular]] and through it found the [[AE Modular]] format. Eureka! It's a modular synthesis standard that uses a 0-5V range.

Thus, clectric is born.

### Digital
Here's an in-exhaustive list of the digital tools that I use:

| **purpose**                   | **tool**                     | **have used** |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| text editing                  | Vim. Flame on!               | nvim          |
| launcher, snippets, clipboard | Raycast                      | Alfred        |
| IDE                           | VSCode                       |               |
| note taking                   | dead trees and Obsidian      | ReMarkable    |
| window manager                | Raycast                      |               |
| PDF eReader                   | ReMarkable                   |               |
| eReader                       | Audible (this counts, right) |               |
### Physical
I live in Atlanta, GA.
Technically *The Atlanta Metro Area™* for those in the know.
#### Workbench
Having (diagnosed and treated) ADHD, my workbench (and other spaces) tend to stay messy.
This is primarily caused by the fact that I have that thing, which probably has a name, where if I don't see it, it may as well not exist.

Here's today's example. I resisted the urge to straighten it up for this photo.

#### "Battlestation"
I have heard this type of setup referred to as a "Battlestation". I am not a musician in the least bit, so you can pretty much call this a "MIDI Station" for me.

#### Desk
I admit that I cleaned up my desk and staged this next photo. I included [Ryder Carroll](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/rydercarroll?srsltid=AfmBOopI8ELUZBVgdGMqOar7f3e8x-XUOpblkBaptPDYe9-ueFj_E_ew)'s book [The Bullet Journal Method](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/book) as a thank you to him and the [BuJo U](https://community.bulletjournal.com) community for (maybe literally) saving my life.

My EDC journal is on the right and my tinkering or design or engineering or whatever journal is on the left.

## Other
To avoid this sounding like a dating profile, I have resisted the urge to write about "other interests" here.
