**FLUX** are firmware programs written for the clectric (or compatible) hardware modules. FLUX define how the module behaves as an oscillator, filter, sequencer, texture generator, or something brand new.

FLUX can be written in several languages, but we encourage you to use [plugdata](plugdata.md). I'll a quote from their own website tell you why:

> plugdata allows you to create and manipulate audio systems using visual elements, rather than writing code. Think of it as building with virtual blocks – simply connect them together to design your unique audio setups. It's a user-friendly and intuitive way to experiment with audio and programming.
